# Speedy CMS Install

How fast can your favourite Content Management System (CMS) be installed? 
We measure an individual's attempts to beat part or all of a CMS install as quickly as possible.

## Rules

There will be an overarching set of rules governing CMS installs across various platforms and technologies. Then within each CMS and the install location, we will have rules governing that particular type of install.

## Learning from others

As much as the idea is to beat others by having a faster install, this site would be a source to find tips, tricks and scripts to speed up your CMS install.

# The overarching rules

A very simplified version of the overarching rules.

1. Start stopwatch
2. Create DB
3. Install CMS
4. Install a starter kit/sample site
5. Load Homepage
6. Stop stopwatch

### Trivia
